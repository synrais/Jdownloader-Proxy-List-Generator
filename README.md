SOCKS4 Proxy Scraper and Validator
Overview
The SOCKS4 Proxy Scraper and Validator is a Python-based tool designed to efficiently scrape SOCKS4 proxies from a specified website, validate their functionality, and organize them into separate lists for easy reference and use. Utilizing asynchronous programming, this script ensures rapid processing, making it ideal for handling large proxy lists.

Features
Automatic Dependency Installation: Checks for and installs required Python packages if they are missing.
Scraping Capability: Extracts SOCKS4 proxies (IP and port) from a specified website.
Dual Output Files:
All Scraped Proxies: Saved to all_scraped_proxies.txt.
Valid Proxies: Filtered and saved to valid_socks4_proxies.txt.
Asynchronous Validation: Utilizes asyncio and aiohttp for fast and efficient proxy testing.
User-Friendly Execution: Provides clear console outputs and pauses at the end for easy result review.
Requirements
Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux.
Python Version: Python 3.7 or higher.
Internet Connection: Required for scraping proxies and validating their functionality.
Installation
Clone or Download the Script:

Save the script to your desired directory, e.g., C:\Users\syntax\Desktop\New folder (5)\proxy_scraper.py.
Run the Script:

Via Terminal:
Open Command Prompt or PowerShell.
Navigate to the script's directory:
powershell
Copy
cd "C:\Users\syntax\Desktop\New folder (5)"
Execute the script:
powershell
Copy
python proxy_scraper.py
By Double-Clicking:
Ensure that .py files are associated with the official Python interpreter.

Navigate to the script location in File Explorer.

Double-click proxy_scraper.py to run.

Note: The script automatically installs any missing dependencies (requests, beautifulsoup4, aiohttp, aiohttp-socks) at runtime. Ensure you have an active internet connection for this process.

Usage
Start the Script:

Upon running, the script will:
Check and install necessary dependencies.
Scrape SOCKS4 proxies from the specified URL (https://socks-proxy.net/#list).
Save all scraped proxies to all_scraped_proxies.txt.
Asynchronously validate each proxy.
Save only the valid proxies to valid_socks4_proxies.txt.
Review Outputs:

All Scraped Proxies: Located in all_scraped_proxies.txt.
Valid Proxies: Located in valid_socks4_proxies.txt.
Console Output: Displays the scraping progress, validation results, and any errors encountered.
Exit the Script:

After processing, the script will prompt:
vbnet
Copy
Press Enter to exit...
Press Enter to close the script window.
Output Files
all_scraped_proxies.txt

Description: Contains a comprehensive list of all SOCKS4 proxies scraped from the source.
Format: Each proxy is listed on a new line in the format socks4://IP:Port.
valid_socks4_proxies.txt

Description: Contains only the proxies that successfully passed the validation tests.
Format: Each valid proxy is listed on a new line in the format socks4://IP:Port.
Troubleshooting
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'aiohttp'

Cause: Dependencies are not installed before attempting to import.
Solution: Ensure that you have an active internet connection when running the script so it can install missing packages automatically. If the issue persists, manually install the required packages:
powershell
Copy
pip install requests beautifulsoup4 aiohttp aiohttp-socks
Script Fails to Run or Closes Immediately:

Cause: Errors occurring before the script completes execution.
Solution: Run the script via Terminal or Command Prompt to view error messages. Ensure all dependencies are installed and that the target website (https://socks-proxy.net/#list) is accessible.
No Proxies Found or Valid Proxies List is Empty:

Cause: The target website may have changed its structure, or the scraped proxies are mostly invalid.
Solution:
Verify that the website structure matches the script's scraping logic. Update the parsing logic if necessary.
Consider using more reliable proxy sources or paid proxy services for higher validity rates.
Best Practices
Regular Updates: Proxies can become inactive quickly. Schedule the script to run periodically to maintain an updated proxy list.
Ethical Usage: Use proxies responsibly and in compliance with target websites' terms of service and legal guidelines.
Resource Management: Adjust the concurrency parameter in the script based on your system's capabilities to optimize performance without overloading your network.
